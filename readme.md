## About the Project

This project was developed for the purpose of analyzing social networks in an academic environment. By utilizing the Louvain algorithm, the project effectively detects and visualizes communities formed within student social networks.

Currently, this repository contains the final results of social network visualizations calculated using Python. 

**Note:** The datasets used in this project are private and are not included in the repository.

## Main Features

- Implementation of the Louvain algorithm for community detection.
- Visualization of social networks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Community calculations performed using Python.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc.)
- A text editor or IDE for code modification (optional)

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rrayhka/Social-Network-Analysis.git
    cd Social-Network-Analysis
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the social network visualization.

## Usage

After opening the `index.html` file, you will see a visual representation of the social network based on the dataset used (not included in this repository). You can modify the `network.js` file to change the configuration or include your own dataset.
